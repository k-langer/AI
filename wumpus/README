A2
Prereq: 
    Python 2.7 or Pypy
    prover9 (on ubuntu: apt-get install prover9)
    a file wumpus_world.txt in the same folder
Install & Run:
    ./A2 [prover9 path]
    NOTE: without a path it assumes that prover9 is in the path
About:
    wumpus_world.txt contains a map specified size given by M**, an agent
    specified with A** and a goal that is reachable specified by GO**. 
    Other features could include a single wumpus W**, a pit P**, and stench
    S** and breezes G** that are specified exactly as adjacent to the wumpus
    and pit. The map could also contain gold anywhere on the map. The amount of
    gold on the map is unknown to the agent. Actually, only the goal, agent location,
    and size of map are known by the agent. Everything else has to be uncovered by
    exploring the world.
Algorithm:
    Logical inference in FOL for finding safe adjacent squares
    Logical inference in FOL for finding all safe squares
    Logical inference in FOL for finding the location of the wumpus
    A* search to find the best path from any two cells
    Heuristic to find the likely closest cell in a list of cells
